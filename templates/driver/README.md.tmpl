# { name | upper } Driver [![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/{ name }.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/{ name }) [![Documentation](https://docs.rs/{ name }/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/{ name }) ![CI Build](https://github.com/braun-embedded/step-dir/workflows/CI%20Build/badge.svg)

## About

Rust driver crate for the [{ name | upper }] stepper motor driver. Carrier boards for this chip are [available from Pololu].

This crate is a specialized facade of the [Step/Dir] library. Please consider using Step/Dir directly, as it provides drivers for more stepper motor drivers, as well as an interface to abstract over them.

See [Step/Dir] for more documentation and usage examples.

## Status

This driver is currently very basic in its capabilities. Its design is experimental, and more revisions to the API are expected.
